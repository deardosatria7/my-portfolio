            Welcome to a snippet of my life story â€” the story of someone who
            started their coding journey in 2020, right at the beginning of my
            university studies. At that time, the first lines of code felt like
            a fun puzzle. Curiosity drove me to keep learning, until I finally
            managed to design my first project for my final university
            assignment â€” a Python learning platform that I named{" "}

            Not only that, but I also have an interest in PC hardware. I have
            always enjoyed assembling PCs, and in 2025, I took the plunge and
            started a small business in the field of <b>custom build PCs</b> â€”
            assembling devices according to specific needs, whether for office
            use or budget gamers. And if you want to build a PC, you can check

            Currently, I am working at a company developing an internal web
            system that helps streamline company operations. Every new challenge
            is a learning opportunity, and every line of code is a new story I
            enjoy.
